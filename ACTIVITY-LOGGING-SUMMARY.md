# Activity Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive activity logging has been implemented across all major operations in the Field Service Management system. All operations now log to the `ActivityLog` table with proper tenant isolation using `CompanyCode`.

## Activity Logging Helper
A centralized `logActivity()` helper function handles all activity log entries with:
- Automatic tenant isolation (CompanyCode)
- User identification (UserID, Username)
- IP Address and User Agent tracking
- Consistent timestamp format
- Error handling (non-critical, logged but doesn't break operations)

## Logged Operations

### ✅ Ticket Management
- **Ticket Created** - When new service tickets are created
- **Ticket Updated** - When ticket status, priority, or other fields change
- **Ticket Audit** - When audit records are added to tickets

### ✅ License Management
- **License Created** - When new software licenses are added
  - Details: Software name, customer, site location
- **License Updated** - When license information is modified
  - Details: Software name, customer, site, status changes

### ✅ Customer Management
- **Customer Created** - When new customers are added
  - Details: Customer name, contact info
- **Customer Updated** - When customer information changes
- **Customer Deleted** - When customers are soft-deleted

### ✅ Vendor Management
- **Vendor Created** - When new vendors are added
  - Details: Vendor name and ID
- **Vendor Updated** - When vendor information is modified
  - Details: Vendor name and ID

### ✅ Site Management
- **Site Created** - When new customer sites are added
- **Site Updated** - When site information changes
- **Site Deleted** - When sites are removed

### ✅ Service Request Management
- **Service Request Submitted** - When customers submit new service requests (PUBLIC)
  - Note: This is a public endpoint, so logging uses system user with CompanyCode from request
- **Ticket Created from Service Request** - When service requests are converted to tickets
  - Details: Ticket ID, service request ID, customer name
- **Service Request Dismissed** - When service requests are dismissed without creating tickets
  - Details: Request ID, customer name, priority, dismissed by user

### ✅ Notes & Communication
- **Note Added** - When coordinator notes are added to tickets
  - Details: Ticket ID, note preview (first 100 characters)

### ✅ Attachment Management
- **Attachment Uploaded** - When files are attached to tickets
  - Details: Filename, file size, ticket ID, description
- **Attachment Deleted** - When attachments are removed
  - Details: Original filename, ticket ID

### ✅ Company/Tenant Management
- **Company Created** - When new tenant companies are added
  - Details: Company name, code, admin user created
- **Company Updated** - When company information is modified
  - Details: Company name and code
- **Company Deactivated** - When companies are soft-deleted
  - Details: Company name and code

## Activity Log Table Schema
```sql
ActivityLog (
  ID NVARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  UserID NVARCHAR(255),
  Username NVARCHAR(255),
  Action NVARCHAR(255),
  Details NVARCHAR(MAX),
  Timestamp DATETIME2,
  CompanyCode VARCHAR(50),  -- Tenant isolation
  IPAddress NVARCHAR(50),
  UserAgent NVARCHAR(500)
)
```

## Activity Log Viewing
Users can view activity logs in the application:
- **Activity Log Page** - Full activity log with filtering options
  - Filter by time range (hours)
  - Filter by user
  - Filter by action type
  - Search functionality
- **Recent Activity Widget** - Dashboard widget showing last 5 activities
- All logs are automatically filtered by the user's CompanyCode (tenant isolation)

## Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Every activity log entry includes `CompanyCode`
- Users can only view activity logs for their own company
- System-level operations (like public service request submissions) log with the target company code
- Cross-tenant data leakage is prevented at the database query level

## Best Practices Implemented
1. ✅ Non-blocking logging - Activity log failures don't break operations
2. ✅ Consistent formatting - All logs use the same helper function
3. ✅ Meaningful details - Each log includes context-specific information
4. ✅ Tenant isolation - CompanyCode is required for all logs
5. ✅ User tracking - UserID and Username captured when available
6. ✅ Audit trail - All create/update/delete operations logged
7. ✅ Network info - IP address and User Agent captured for security

## Testing
All endpoints have been tested and confirmed working:
- Activity logs appear in the Activity Log page
- Multi-tenant isolation verified
- Timestamps are accurate
- Details are properly formatted
- No performance impact from logging

## Deployment
- ✅ Updated `server/api.cjs` with comprehensive logging
- ✅ Deployed to Azure App Service (field-service-api.azurewebsites.net)
- ✅ API restarted and tested successfully
- ✅ All endpoints operational with logging active
