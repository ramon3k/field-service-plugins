# Multi-Tenant Security Architecture

## üîí Security Overview

This field service application implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect tenant data and prevent common multi-tenant vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Tenant Isolation**
- **Database-per-tenant**: Each company has their own isolated SQL database
- **No shared data**: Complete data separation between tenants
- **Encrypted connection strings**: All database connections are encrypted in the master registry

### 2. **Authentication Security**
- **Manual tenant code entry**: No tenant enumeration via dropdowns
- **JWT tokens with tenant context**: Tokens are bound to specific tenants
- **Password hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **Session management**: Proper token expiration and renewal

### 3. **Rate Limiting & Anti-Enumeration**
- **Tenant lookup rate limiting**: Max 5 attempts per IP in 15 minutes
- **No tenant listing endpoints**: Companies must know their tenant code
- **Invalid tenant logging**: Failed lookups are logged for monitoring
- **Tenant code format validation**: Prevents injection attempts

### 4. **Data Protection**
- **Connection string encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for database credentials
- **Audit logging**: All tenant actions are logged with IP and user agent
- **Secure headers**: CORS, helmet, and other security middleware
- **Input validation**: All tenant codes and inputs are validated

### 5. **Network Security**
- **HTTPS enforcement**: SSL/TLS required in production
- **IP whitelisting**: Optional restriction to known IP ranges
- **CORS configuration**: Strict origin validation
- **Request validation**: All API requests are validated for tenant context

## üö® Security Best Practices for Administrators

### **Tenant Code Management**
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Use unique, non-obvious tenant codes (e.g., "acme2024", "techcorp-prod")
- Share tenant codes securely via encrypted channels
- Rotate tenant codes if compromised
- Use alphanumeric codes with hyphens/underscores

‚ùå DON'T:
- Use company names as tenant codes ("Microsoft", "Google")
- Share tenant codes in plain text emails
- Use sequential or guessable codes ("tenant1", "company2")
- Use special characters that could cause injection issues
```

### **Password Policies**
```
‚úÖ ENFORCE:
- Minimum 12 characters for admin accounts
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No password reuse for last 12 passwords
- Regular password rotation (90 days for admins)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts

‚ùå AVOID:
- Default passwords (admin/admin, password123)
- Shared accounts between users
- Passwords containing company name or tenant code
- Weak passwords for any user level
```

### **Database Security**
```
‚úÖ IMPLEMENT:
- Dedicated SQL logins per tenant database
- Principle of least privilege for database access
- Regular database backups with encryption
- Database firewall rules restricting access
- Monitor for unusual query patterns

‚ùå NEVER:
- Use SA or admin accounts for application connections
- Store connection strings in plain text
- Share database credentials between tenants
- Allow direct database access from public internet
```

## üîç Security Monitoring

### **Audit Logs to Monitor**
- Failed tenant lookup attempts
- Multiple login failures from same IP
- Unusual database access patterns
- API requests without proper tenant context
- Cross-tenant data access attempts

### **Security Alerts**
- More than 10 failed tenant lookups per hour
- Login attempts with invalid tenant codes
- Database connection failures
- Unusual geographic access patterns
- API rate limit violations

## üöÄ Deployment Security Checklist

### **Production Environment**
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed and configured
- [ ] Environment variables for secrets (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Database connections use encrypted connections
- [ ] CORS configured for production domains only
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled for all endpoints
- [ ] Security headers configured (helmet middleware)
- [ ] Audit logging enabled and monitored
- [ ] Regular security scans scheduled

### **Tenant Onboarding Security**
- [ ] Unique tenant codes generated (not company names)
- [ ] Dedicated database created with proper permissions
- [ ] Initial admin account with strong password
- [ ] Connection strings encrypted in tenant registry
- [ ] Tenant isolation verified before go-live
- [ ] Security training provided to tenant admins

## üìã Security Incident Response

### **If Tenant Code is Compromised**
1. Immediately disable the tenant in registry database
2. Generate new tenant code and update all systems
3. Force password reset for all tenant users
4. Review audit logs for unauthorized access
5. Notify tenant administrator of the incident

### **If Database Breach is Suspected**
1. Isolate affected tenant database immediately
2. Review all audit logs for suspicious activity
3. Change all database connection credentials
4. Run security scan on database server
5. Notify affected customers within 72 hours

## üîê Key Security Features Summary

| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Tenant Isolation** | Database-per-tenant | Complete data separation |
| **No Enumeration** | Manual tenant codes only | Prevents tenant discovery |
| **Rate Limiting** | 5 attempts/15min per IP | Prevents brute force |
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM for connections | Protects credentials |
| **Audit Logging** | All actions logged | Security monitoring |
| **Input Validation** | Regex validation + sanitization | Prevents injection |
| **JWT Security** | Tenant-bound tokens | Prevents cross-tenant access |
| **Password Security** | bcrypt + salt | Secure password storage |

This security architecture ensures that each tenant operates in complete isolation with enterprise-grade protection against common multi-tenant vulnerabilities.
