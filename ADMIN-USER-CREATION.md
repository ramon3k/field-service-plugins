# Admin User Creation Feature

## Overview
When creating a new company in the Company Management interface, the system now requires creating an initial administrator account. This ensures that each new company has at least one admin user who can login and manage their company's data.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `src/components/CompanyManagementPage.tsx`

#### Form Fields Added
When creating a new company (not editing), the form now includes:
- **Admin Username** (required) - Unique username for the admin
- **Admin Email** (required) - Contact email for the admin
- **Admin Full Name** (required) - Display name
- **Admin Password** (required, min 8 characters) - Initial password

#### UI Features
- Admin user section only appears when **creating** a new company
- Section has a visual divider with heading "ðŸ‘¤ Initial Admin User"
- All admin fields are required
- Password field has minimum 8 character validation
- Form validation prevents submission if admin fields are incomplete

#### CSS Styling
**File**: `src/components/CompanyManagementPage.css`

Added `.form-section-divider` styles to create visual separation between company info and admin user sections.

### Backend Changes
**File**: `server/api.cjs`

#### API Endpoint Modified
`POST /api/companies` - Now creates both company and admin user in a single transaction

#### Request Body
```javascript
{
  // Company fields
  companyCode: string,
  companyName: string,
  displayName: string,
  contactEmail: string,
  contactPhone: string,
  address: string,
  isActive: boolean,
  allowServiceRequests: boolean,
  
  // Admin user fields (NEW - required)
  adminUsername: string,
  adminEmail: string,
  adminFullName: string,
  adminPassword: string
}
```

#### Validation
- Company code and name are required
- Admin username, email, full name, and password are required
- Company code must be unique
- Admin username must be unique
- Returns 400 if validation fails
- Returns 409 if company code or username already exists

#### Transaction Logic
1. **Begin Transaction** - Ensures atomicity
2. **Create Company** - Insert into Companies table
3. **Hash Password** - Base64 encoding (matches existing pattern)
4. **Create Admin User** - Insert into Users table with:
   - Role: 'Admin'
   - CompanyCode: Matches the new company
   - IsActive: 1 (active by default)
5. **Commit Transaction** - Both records created or both rolled back
6. **Rollback on Error** - Prevents partial creation

#### Response
```javascript
{
  company: {
    CompanyID: number,
    CompanyCode: string,
    CompanyName: string,
    DisplayName: string,
    // ... other company fields
  },
  adminUser: {
    UserID: number,
    Username: string,
    Email: string,
    FullName: string,
    Role: "Admin",
    CompanyCode: string
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### Creating a New Company
1. Click "âž• Add New Company" button
2. Fill in company information:
   - Company Code (unique, uppercase, no spaces)
   - Company Name
   - Display Name (optional)
   - Contact Email
   - Contact Phone
   - Address
3. Fill in admin user information:
   - Admin Username (unique)
   - Admin Email
   - Admin Full Name
   - Admin Password (minimum 8 characters)
4. Check/uncheck:
   - Active (company is operational)
   - Allow Service Requests (customers can submit requests)
5. Click "Create Company"

### After Creation
- Company appears in the companies table
- Admin user can login using:
  - Username: The admin username provided
  - Password: The admin password provided
  - Company Code: The company code of the new company
- Admin has full permissions to manage their company

### Editing Existing Company
- Admin user section does NOT appear when editing
- Cannot create additional admin users through this interface
- Use User Management to add more users after company creation

## Security Features

### Transaction Safety
- Uses SQL transactions to ensure both company and admin are created together
- If admin user creation fails, company creation is rolled back
- Prevents orphaned companies without admin users

### Password Handling
- Passwords are base64 encoded before storage (matches existing pattern)
- Minimum 8 character requirement on frontend
- Password is never logged or returned in API responses

### Username Uniqueness
- System checks for duplicate usernames across ALL companies
- Returns 409 Conflict error if username already exists
- Prevents login confusion

## Database Schema

### Companies Table
No changes required - existing schema supports all fields.

### Users Table
No changes required. Admin users are created with:
- `Role = 'Admin'`
- `CompanyCode = <new company code>`
- `IsActive = 1`

## Testing Procedure

### Test Case 1: Successful Company + Admin Creation
1. Create new company with all required fields
2. Verify company appears in table
3. Login with admin credentials
4. Verify admin can access the system
5. Verify admin sees their CompanyCode in header

### Test Case 2: Duplicate Company Code
1. Create company with code "TEST"
2. Try to create another company with code "TEST"
3. Verify 409 error: "Company code already exists"

### Test Case 3: Duplicate Username
1. Create company with admin username "admin1"
2. Try to create another company with admin username "admin1"
3. Verify 409 error: "Admin username already exists"

### Test Case 4: Missing Admin Fields
1. Fill in company fields only
2. Leave admin fields blank
3. Try to submit
4. Verify validation prevents submission

### Test Case 5: Transaction Rollback
1. Simulate database error during user creation
2. Verify company is NOT created
3. Verify no partial records in database

## Known Limitations

### Single Admin Only
- Only one admin can be created during company setup
- Additional admins must be added through User Management after creation

### Password Reset
- Initial password cannot be changed during setup
- Admin must use "Change Password" feature after first login

### No Edit Mode
- Cannot modify admin user through company edit form
- Must use User Management to edit user details

## Future Enhancements

### Planned
1. Send welcome email to admin with login instructions
2. Require password confirmation field
3. Password strength indicator
4. Option to auto-generate secure password
5. Ability to create multiple admins during setup

### Under Consideration
1. Two-factor authentication for admins
2. Password complexity requirements
3. Account activation workflow
4. Audit log for admin user creation
